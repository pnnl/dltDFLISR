abstract = {Abstract By changing the status of switches on distribution feeders, service to de-energized customers can be restored after an occurrence of a fault. In this paper, multi-agent system (MAS) is applied for the power distribution system service restoration task using local information by utilizing the characteristics of information sharing. Each software agent is running autonomously and is able to exchange information within limited distance. Every agent is capable of performing service restoration such that service restoration can be performed in parallel when a multiple fault scenario occurs. As a result, the outage period can be reduced. BDI (believe–desire–intention) agent architecture is implemented in this paper for group and zone service restoration for power distribution systems. Zone/switch relation table is built and used by agents in order to identify adequate switching actions during the service restoration planning stage. The proposed MAS is implemented on JADE (Java Agent Development) platform. The simulation results show that the proposed BDI-based service restoration agent system is capable of providing adequate restoration switching plan in several scenarios.

abstract = {Demand Response (DR) is progressively moving from a centralized, unidirectional structure to a set of advanced decentralized mechanisms that better balance distributed supply and demand. This paper presents a decentralized cooperative DR framework to manage the daily energy exchanges within a community of Smart-Buildings, in the presence of local Renewable Energy Sources (RES). The proposed algorithm taps into the flexibility of the participants to let them decide of a day-ahead community power profile, and subsequently ensures the forecast tracking during the next day. In practice, the algorithm is fully decentralized by the Blockchain technology, that enables a trusted communication medium among the participants and enforces autonomous monitoring and billing via Smart-Contracts. With such an energy management framework, participating Smart-Buildings can together aim at a common objective, such as carbon-free resources usage or aggregated grid services, without depending on a centralized aggregator/utility. Simulations on realistic Swiss building models demonstrate that nearly all the renewable production resources could be harnessed locally through the presented framework, compared to selfish individual optimization. Under a quadratic cost of grid electricity, the considered community profile could dramatically be flattened, hence avoiding costly peaks at the grid interface. A scalability analysis shows that, considering the current public Ethereum Blockchain, the framework could handle a community size of up to 100 Smart-Buildings.}

abstract = {There has been significant recent interest in local electricity trading platforms, and particularly in the application of distributed ledger and blockchain technology for distributed, or peer-to-peer energy trading in local energy communities. Several projects worldwide have demonstrated this concept on a small scale in Low Voltage (LV) distribution networks and microgrids. However, previous work in this area has not sufficiently addressed the potential impacts of peer-to-peer energy trading and other local electricity trading mechanisms on the control, operation and planning of the electricity distribution networks. Accordingly, this paper presents a methodology for the co-simulation of power distribution networks and local peer-to-peer energy trading platforms. The distribution system simulator is interfaced with a peer-to-peer energy trading platform, which employs a blockchain-based distributed double auction trade mechanism. The presented co-simulation approach is demonstrated using a case study of typical European suburban distribution network. It is demonstrated in the paper that this approach can be used to analyse the impacts of peer-to-peer energy trading on network operational performance. The analysis presented in the paper suggests that a moderate level of peer-to-peer trading does not have significant impacts on network operational performance.}
