===========================

Version 0.0.1
----------------------

**Alfa version of DLTDFLISR.**

1. `Features:`

    - Simulation evaluation of distributed fault location isolation ans system restoration (DFLISR)
    - Utilizing the distributed implementation of GridAPPSD
    - Scripts for making and populating a test case in GridAPPSD
    - Contain a example test case and the needed input files for the DFLISR application

2. `Limitations of alfa version:`

    - Multiple input files that are case dependent are needed
    - Interaction with GridAPPSD
        - Time waiting to avid different times in multiple agents and simulation
        - Simulation time is obtain from the centralized GridAPPSD sensors measurement
